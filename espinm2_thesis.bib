abstract = "Abstract We present a study of a tangible user interface for design and simulation applied to architectural daylighting analysis. This tool provides an intuitive way for architects and future occupants of a building to quickly construct physical models and interactively view in them a projected simulation of resulting daylighting. A user study was conducted of both architecture students and non-architects in a set of analysis and design exercises. The study investigates the effectiveness of this interface as an educational tool, the precision and accuracy of the constructed physical models, and its effectiveness for creative design exploration. The four part study investigates users' intuitions about daylighting and their interaction with the tangible user interface for analysis of an existing space. These exercises revealed and corrected misconceptions in many of the participants' intuitions about daylighting, and overall the participants praised the ease-of-use of the tool and expressed interest in this simulation tool for daylighting analysis in architectural design.

@article{Raghuvanshi2009,
abstract = {Accurate sound rendering can add significant realism to complement visual display in interactive applications, as well as facilitate acoustic predictions for many engineering applications, like accurate acoustic analysis for architectural design. Numerical simulation can provide this realism most naturally by modeling the underlying physics of wave propagation. However, wave simulation has traditionally posed a tough computational challenge. In this paper, we present a technique which relies on an adaptive rectangular decomposition of 3D scenes to enable efficient and accurate simulation of sound propagation in complex virtual environments. It exploits the known analytical solution of the Wave Equation in rectangular domains, and utilizes an efficient implementation of the Discrete Cosine Transform on Graphics Processors (GPU) to achieve at least a 100-fold performance gain compared to a standard Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) implementation with comparable accuracy, while also being 10-fold more memory efficient. Consequently, we are able to perform accurate numerical acoustic simulation on large, complex scenes in the kilohertz range. To the best of our knowledge, it was not previously possible to perform such simulations on a desktop computer. Our work thus enables acoustic analysis on large scenes and auditory display for complex virtual environments on commodity hardware.},

@article{Funkhouser2004,
abstract = {A difficult challenge in geometrical acoustic modeling is computing propagation paths from sound sources to receivers fast enough for interactive applications. This paper describes a beam tracing method that enables interactive updates of propagation paths from a stationary source to a moving receiver in large building interiors. During a precomputation phase, convex polyhedral beams traced from the location of each sound source are stored in a "beam tree" representing the regions of space reachable by potential sequences of transmissions, diffractions, and specular reflections at surfaces of a 3D polygonal model. Then, during an interactive phase, the precomputed beam tree(s) are used to generate propagation paths from the source(s) to any receiver location at interactive rates. The key features of this beam tracing method are (1) it scales to support large building environments, (2) it models propagation due to edge diffraction, (3) it finds all propagation paths up to a given termination criterion without exhaustive search or risk of under-sampling, and (4) it updates propagation paths at interactive rates. The method has been demonstrated to work effectively in interactive acoustic design and virtual walkthrough applications.},
